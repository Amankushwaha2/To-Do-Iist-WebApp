# TO-DO-LIST-WEBAPP

This is a simple web application that allows you to manage your to-do list. You can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: You can easily add new tasks to your to-do list by typing them into the input field and pressing the Enter key or clicking the "Add" button.

- **Mark tasks as completed**: Once you have completed a task, you can mark it as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to the task. The task will be visually differentiated to indicate its completion.

- **Delete tasks**: If you no longer need a task, you can delete it from the list by clicking on the delete button (represented by a trash can icon) next to the task.

- **Persistence**: The application uses the browser's local storage to persist the tasks. This means that even if you close the application or refresh the page, your tasks will still be saved and loaded when you reopen the application.
